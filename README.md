# JohnXue-DiceRoll-JavaScript

This is an interactive small game that allows 2 people to compete on rolling dice.  The first player gets 20 points or more will be the winner.  

Interestingly, it's a turn-based game but each player can roll the dice MULTIPLE times IF they are lucky, which means a player can win the game in one go by accumulating more than 20 points and holding them at the end.  However, there's a catch: Once a player gets 1 point in a roll, he loses all the points he gets in THIS round (still keep the points from previous rounds) and the game moves on to the next round.  

Make smart choice, don't get greedy. Good luck!
